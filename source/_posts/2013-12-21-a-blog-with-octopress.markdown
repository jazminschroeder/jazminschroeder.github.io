I decided to start a new technical blog, the main purpose is to keep a record of things I have learned which could potentially help others. My first obvious choice was Wordpress after all is the number one bloging engine out there but somebody mentioned Octopress and so here we are.

Octopress is a framework for Jekyll the blog static site generator powering Github Pages. If you enjoy working with the console then Octopress will feel very comfortable. There are a lot of resources out there to get you started with <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a> and github pages,  <a href="http://octopress.org" target="_blank">Octopress</a> just makes it dead simple to get up and running in no time and there are a lot of themes and plugins ready to use to make your blog your own.

Use your favorite editor, commit to Github, deploy with a simple rake task and host your blog at Github for free. How can you go wrong with that?
